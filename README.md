# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
This report will summarizes how the data differs by city type(Urban, Suburban, and Rural)
and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results Summary DataFrame

From the summary dataframe we see that as population density increases, so does number of rides,
total drivers, and total fare volume. The ratio of rides to drivers is much higher in rural areas.
In the rural areas, demand is high and is well outreaching the number of drivers in the area.
In Urban areas, the opposite is true, and this shows that there is a surplus of supply. Also in rural 
areas the average fare is much higher than in urban or suburban. The would indicate rides cover a 
longer distance in the rural landscape. And this would also confirm that the average fares for the 
rural driver is higher than in urban.

## Results Total Fare by City Type

Frim the line chart describing the total fares by city type, we see the urban market is making more money
than the other two markets. This would be attributed to the population size and higher demand for
ride shares. This analysis shows that rural tends to be up and down on a weekly basis. 

## Summary
Three business recommendations based on our analysis would be to (1)decrease the number of drivers for
the urban market. This will increase average ride and driver fares. Mover some of those drivers to
the other two markets. (2)Increase drivers for the sububan market. We can double the total fare of 
suburban by using less riders and drivers than urban. (3) Suburban is trending up toward spring and
summer so put more drivers and resources to that market.
