and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

From the summary dataframe we see that as population density increases, so does number of rides,
total drivers, and total fare volume. The ratio of rides to drivers is much higher in rural areas.
In the rural areas, demand is high and is well outreaching the number of drivers in the area.
In Urban areas, the opposite is true, and this shows that there is a surplus of supply. Also in rural 
areas the average fare is much higher than in urban or suburban. The would indicate rides cover a 
longer distance in the rural landscape. And this would also confirm that the average fares for the 
rural driver is higher than in urban.
